        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          After completing my 3-year advanced diploma in Biotechnology, I
          realized that many fields were opening more and more to those with
          coding backgrounds. In order to stay competitive and relevant, I
          decided to go back to school. Having worked in virus/vaccine
          research, I noticed the need in spatial data mapping for outbreaks,
          threat-level detection, etc. For such reasons, University of
          Victoria's combined major program in Geomatics caught my eye. With
          the benefit of the program being a general computer science degree,
          it provides me with an opportunity to branch out and learn other
          skills.
